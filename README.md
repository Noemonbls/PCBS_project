Reproduction of the experiment in Shams et al 2000

The main goal of the experiment is to prove that audio stimulus can impact visual perception : 
We are trying here to design an experiment which is supposed to implement a multisensory illusion. 
If we present participants with a single flash of light and multiple audio beeps, they will report seeing more than one flash of light.
This is particularly interesting because this flash of light is an unambiguous stimulus, which means that participants should be very good at the task
It shows that the visual modality is not as central as we may be prone to think, since we show here that audio perception overrides visual stimulus classification.
