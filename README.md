 ## PCBS project NoÃ«mon BAUDOUIN

Reproduction of the experiment in Shams et al 2000

The main goal of the experiment is to prove that audio stimuli can impact visual perception : 
We are trying here to design an experiment which is supposed to implement a multisensory illusion. 
If we present participants with a single flash of light and multiple audio beeps, they will report seeing more than one flash of light.
This is particularly interesting because this flash of light is an unambiguous stimulus, which means that participants should be very good at the task.
It shows that the visual modality is not as central as we may be prone to think, since we show here that audio perception overrides visual stimulus classification.


audiovisual_illusion.py contains the code needed to run the experiment, which calls useful_functions_PCBS_project. You will need a numeric keypad for this program to function correctly. 
The data analysis pipeline is contained in data_analysis, and plots the data contained in the "data" folder.

Finally, data_analysis_notebook contains the analysis I've obtained with the data I've recolted, and a few comments.

To run the code, simply download this repository as a zip file, extract it anywhere, and run audiovisual_illusion.py
